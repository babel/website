:::info
This plugin is included in `@babel/preset-env`
:::

Some words were reserved in ES3 as potential future keywords but were not
reserved in ES5 and later. This plugin, to be used when targeting ES3
environments, renames variables from that set of words.

## Example

**In**

```js title="JavaScript"
var abstract = 1;
var x = abstract + 1;
```

**Out**

```js title="JavaScript"
var _abstract = 1;
var x = _abstract + 1;
```

## Installation

```shell npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-reserved-words
```

## Usage

### With a configuration file (Recommended)

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-transform-reserved-words"]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh title="Shell"
babel --plugins @babel/plugin-transform-reserved-words script.js
```

### Via Node API

```js title="JavaScript"
require("@babel/core").transformSync("code", {
  plugins: ["@babel/plugin-transform-reserved-words"],
});
```
