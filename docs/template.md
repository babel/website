In computer science, this is known as an implementation of quasiquotes.

## Install

```shell npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @babel/template
```

## String Usage

When calling `template` as a function with a string argument, you can provide _placeholders_ which will get substituted when the template is used.

You can use two different kinds of placeholders: syntactic placeholders (e.g. `%%name%%`) or identifier placeholders (e.g. `NAME`). `@babel/template` supports both those approaches by default, but they can't be mixed. If you need to be explicit about what syntax you are using, you can use the [`syntacticPlaceholders`](#syntacticplaceholders) option.

Please note that syntactic placeholders were introduced in Babel 7.4.0. If you don't control the `@babel/template` version (for example, when importing it from a `@babel/core@^7.0.0` peer dependency), you must use identifier placeholders. On the other hand, syntactic placeholders have some advantages: they can be used where identifiers would be a syntax error (e.g. in place of function bodies, or in export declarations), and they don't conflict with uppercase variables (e.g., `new URL()`).

Input (syntactic placeholders):

```js title="JavaScript"
import template from "@babel/template";
import generate from "@babel/generator";
import * as t from "@babel/types";

const buildRequire = template(`
  var %%importName%% = require(%%source%%);
`);

const ast = buildRequire({
  importName: t.identifier("myModule"),
  source: t.stringLiteral("my-module"),
});

console.log(generate(ast).code);
```

Input (identifier placeholders):

```js title="JavaScript"
const buildRequire = template(`
  var IMPORT_NAME = require(SOURCE);
`);

const ast = buildRequire({
  IMPORT_NAME: t.identifier("myModule"),
  SOURCE: t.stringLiteral("my-module"),
});
```

Output:

```js title="JavaScript"
const myModule = require("my-module");
```

### `.ast`

If no placeholders are in use and you just want a simple way to parse a
string into an AST, you can use the `.ast` version of the template.

```js title="JavaScript"
const ast = template.ast(`
  var myModule = require("my-module");
`);
```

which will parse and return the AST directly.

## Template Literal Usage

```js title="JavaScript"
import template from "@babel/template";
import generate from "@babel/generator";
import * as t from "@babel/types";

const source = "my-module";

const fn = template`
  var IMPORT_NAME = require('${source}');
`;

const ast = fn({
  IMPORT_NAME: t.identifier("myModule"),
});

console.log(generate(ast).code);
```

Note that placeholders can be passed directly as part of the template literal
in order to make things as readable as possible, or they can be passed into
the template function.

### `.ast`

If no placeholders are in use and you just want a simple way to parse a
string into an AST, you can use the `.ast` version of the template.

```js title="JavaScript"
const name = "my-module";
const mod = "myModule";

const ast = template.ast`
  var ${mod} = require("${name}");
`;
```

which will parse and return the AST directly. Note that unlike the string-based
version mentioned earlier, since this is a template literal, it is still
valid to perform replacements using template literal replacements.

## AST results

The `@babel/template` API exposes a few flexible APIs to make it as easy as
possible to create ASTs with an expected structure. Each of these also has
the `.ast` property mentioned above.

### `template`

`template` returns either a single statement, or an array of
statements, depending on the parsed result.

### `template.smart`

This is the same as the default `template` API, returning either a single
node, or an array of nodes, depending on the parsed result.

### `template.statement`

`template.statement("foo;")()` returns a single statement node, and throw
an exception if the result is anything but a single statement.

### `template.statements`

`template.statements("foo;foo;")()` returns an array of statement nodes.

### `template.expression`

`template.expression("foo")()` returns the expression node.

### `template.program`

`template.program("foo;")()` returns the `Program` node for the template.

## API

### `template(code, [opts])`

#### code

Type: `string`

#### options

`@babel/template` accepts all of the options from [Babel Parser](parser.md#options), and specifies
some defaults of its own:

- `allowReturnOutsideFunction` is set to `true` by default.
- `allowSuperOutsideMethod` is set to `true` by default.
- `sourceType` is set to `module` by default.

#### syntacticPlaceholders

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true` if `%%foo%%`-style placeholders are used; `false` otherwise.
Added in: `v7.4.0`

When this option is `true`, you can use `%%foo%%` to mark placeholders in
your templates. When it is `false`, placeholders are identifiers determined
by the `placeholderWhitelist` and `placeholderPattern` options.

##### placeholderWhitelist

Type: `Set<string>`
Default: `undefined`

> This option is not compatible with `syntacticPlaceholders: true`

A set of placeholder names to automatically accept. Items in this list do
not need to match the given placeholder pattern.

##### placeholderPattern

Type: `RegExp | false`
Default: `/^[_$A-Z0-9]+$/`

> This option is not compatible with `syntacticPlaceholders: true`

A pattern to search for when looking for Identifier and StringLiteral
nodes that should be considered placeholders.
'false' will disable placeholder searching entirely, leaving only the
'placeholderWhitelist' value to find placeholders.

##### preserveComments

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Set this to `true` to preserve any comments from the `code` parameter.

#### Return value

By default `@babel/template` returns a `function` which is invoked with an
optional object of replacements. See the usage section for an example.

When using `.ast`, the AST will be returned directly.
