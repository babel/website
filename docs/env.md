> We're super ðŸ˜¸ excited that you're trying to use ES2015 syntax, but instead of continuing yearly presets, the team recommends using babel-preset-env. By default, it has the same behavior as previous presets to compile ES2015+ to ES5.
> Please check out the [v1.x readme for more info](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/tree/1.x). (For Babel 7, we have moved the preset into the [main babel repo](preset-env.md).

### Babel 7

If you are using Babel version 7 you will need to run `npm install @babel/preset-env` and have `"presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]` in your configuration.

## Before you do anything

You might end up on this page because you saw a message in the terminal like this:

> ðŸ™Œ Thanks for using Babel: we recommend using babel-preset-env now: please read [babeljs.io/env](https://babeljs.io/env) to update!

Before you proceed further, ask yourself: are you _using_ Babel? Check your `package.json` and look for `babel-preset-es2015` or a similar preset there. If you see a preset like this in your `package.json`, read on!

If you don't use Babel or don't use deprecated yearly presets, you probably saw this message because _another package_ you depend on uses them. **In that case there's nothing _you_ need to do**. Nevertheless, it might be a good idea to find out which package uses the deprecated presets, and help them migrate by sending a pull request. You can find this out by running `npm ls babel-preset-es2015` which will show the dependency tree.

## Upgrading to `babel-preset-env`

### Install

```shell npm2yarn
npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev
```

#### Basic [options](options.md) change

```diff
{
+  "presets": ["env"]
-  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
```

#### [options](options.md) change with preset options

```diff
{
  "presets": [
+   ["env", {
-   ["es2015", {
      "modules": false
    }]
  ]
}
```

`babel-preset-env` is a new preset, first released over a year ago that replaces many presets that were previously used including:

- `babel-preset-es2015`, `babel-preset-es2016`, `babel-preset-es2017`
- `babel-preset-latest`
- other community plugins involving `es20xx`:
  - `babel-preset-node5`, `babel-preset-es2015-node`, etc

## By targeting specific browsers, Babel can do less work so you can ship native ES2015+ ðŸ˜Ž!

#### [options](options.md) against a specific chrome version

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "chrome": "60"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

#### [options](options.md) against current node version

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "node": "current"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```
