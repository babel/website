> ðŸš¨ As of Babel 7.8.0, this package has been deprecated. It is now included in [@babel/standalone](standalone.md#usage).

# Installation

There are several ways to use @babel/preset-env-standalone. Pick whichever one you like:

- Use it via UNPKG: https://unpkg.com/@babel/preset-env-standalone@7/babel-preset-env.min.js. This is a simple way to embed it on a webpage without having to do any other setup.
- Install via NPM: `npm install --save @babel/preset-env-standalone`
- Manually grab `babel-preset-env.js` and/or `babel-preset-env.min.js`:
  - Download archived source code from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases).
  - Unpack it.
  - Grab `babel-preset-env.js` and/or `babel-preset-env.min.js` from `packages/babel-preset-env-standalone`.

# Usage

Load `babel-preset-env.js` or `babel-preset-env.min.js` in your environment, **along with babel-standalone**. This is important: You need to load Babel too! It will be registered as an available preset of the @babel/standalone.

Then, just use it like any other preset:

```js title="JavaScript"
Babel.transform(code, {
  presets: [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        targets: {
          browsers: "last 1 safari version",
        },
        useBuiltIns: "usage",
      },
    ],
  ],
});
```
