### `babel-browser` has been removed.

Use a bundler like [browserify](http://babeljs.io/docs/setup/#browserify)/[webpack](http://babeljs.io/docs/setup/#webpack) or just `require('babel-core')`.

    Compiling in the browser has a fairly limited use case, so if you are
    working on a production site you should be precompiling your scripts
    server-side. See <a href="/docs/setup/#build-systems">setup build systems</a>
    for more information.
