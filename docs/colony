#I have never cheated anyone. Do any business with perseverance, perseverance, because of all honesty that has always been firmly established in the heart. These things will have no effect. If I am constantly jealous and staring at other people's work or their achievements because this does not add to my managerial abilities whatsoever I am interested in success  What is he doing to succeed in his career and I have never neglected the accuracy, not bringing any part that is the delicate information of other users, even if it is a program that is used. free Yes, but the word user information is not for anyone to use easily. Distinguish. Don't faint. When you don't know how to manage, you can't do it yourself. Never have experience. Don't touch it. Even if you have a consultant, you will never survive believing in this. Because I have always read and studied at the point of failure  Every case has the same ending, that is, thinking that you are smart and can do better than the owner, or want to be the owner without investing in any effort or it's not the people in our house, in the end, it's 100% ruined because it doesn't have a pattern from the start, but plans to steal. Even if Dr. does not know how to manage it, Dr. will make a mistake because there is only one style in the world, different people have different styles. So I keep following that I would not do anything that is repeated with anyone or doing anything. When there is no difference, there will be only competitors and cheating. Excuse me Barbell, I was born in Windows and Uncle Bill still follows me and the address that comes with Bill, Yahoo, Google, I can't say all of them are too long. I repeat in the rules that from now on no one can create codes that can take away any of the user's assets again and ask the staff in charge to be honest with their duty to do their best to honor the people who He puts his hopes on you because if you can do it, you are truly honorable no matter what position you are in.
