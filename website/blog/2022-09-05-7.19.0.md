We just published Babel 7.19.0!

This release updates our implementation of the [decorators proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators), which reached Stage 3 in March. It also includes support for the new [duplicate named capturing groups proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups) for regular expressions.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.19.0).

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://github.com/babel/babel?sponsor=1) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### New default values

Given the stabilization of the [decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) and [Record and Tuple](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) proposal, we set some default values for their [parser plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser#plugins-options) options:
- `decorators`/`@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`'s `decoratorsBeforeExport` now defaults to `false`;
- `recordAndTuple`/`@babel/plugin-proposal-record-and-tuple`'s `syntaxType` option now defaults to `hash`.

These options will be removed in Babel 8.

### Stage 3 decorators ([#14836](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14836))

The decorators proposal was promoted to Stage 3 with some minor but observable changes. You can enable the new version using the `"version": "2022-03"` option of `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators", {
        "version": "2022-03"
    }]
  ]
}
```

If you are migrating from the `2021-12` version, the following breaking changes might affect you:
- the `initialize` method of the object returned by accessor decorators has been renamed to `init`;
- the `isPrivate` and `isStatic` properties of the `context` parameter received by the decorators (the second one) have been renamed to `private` and `static`;
- the `context` parameter now always has an `access` property, regardless of the decorated element type;
- support for metadata (`getMetadata`/`setMetadata`) has been removed and [postponed to a future proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorator-metadata);
- `@(expression)()`-style decorators are disallowed, and you must use `@(expression())`;
- decorators are applied in the following order, instead of in a single pass:
  1. static method decorators
  1. proto method decorators
  1. static field decorators
  1. instance field decorators
  1. class decorators.

If you are migrating from an older version of the proposal, we suggest reading [the full README](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). 😉

> 💡 TypeScript [plans to implement](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/48885) this version of the proposal. After almost a decade, it will be possible to write decorators without worrying if they will be compiled by Babel or tsc! 

### RegExp duplicate named capturing groups ([#14805](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14805))

Babel now supports the [RegExp duplicate named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups/) proposal, which allows re-using the same group name in alternative RegExp branches:

```javascript
const dateRE = /(?<year>\d\d\d\d)-(?<month>\d\d)|(?<month>\d\d)-(?<year>\d\d)/;

console.log("2022-12".match(dateRE).groups); // { year: "2022", month: "12" }
console.log("12-2022".match(dateRE).groups); // { year: "2022", month: "12" }
```

You can enable this proposal using the `@babel/plugin-proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups-regex` plugin:
```json
{
  "plugins": ["@babel/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups-regex"]
}
```

Babel relies on different third-party packages to transform regular expressions: this is possible thanks to the maintainers of [regjsparser](https://github.com/jviereck/regjsparser/), [regjsgen](http://github.com/benjamn/regjsgen) and [regexpu-core](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regexpu-core/) who took time to review our pull requests!
