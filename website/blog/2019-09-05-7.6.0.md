We just released a new minor Babel version!

It includes support for static private accessors in classes, and parser support for the V8 intrinsics syntax. We also fixed a bunch of long-stansing issues related to TDZ handling, and improved support for do-expressions. You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.6.0).

[**Bloomberg**](https://github.com/bloomberg) is continuing to sponsor the implementation of new class features in Babel: after giving us a lot of new class features ([static private fields](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/09/17/7.1.0#private-static-fields-stage-3), [private instance methods](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/12/03/7.2.0#private-instance-methods-8654-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-8654), [private instance accessors](https://babeljs.io/blog/2019/01/21/7.3.0#private-instance-accessors-getters-and-setters-9101-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-9101), and [static private methods](https://babeljs.io/blog/2019/03/19/7.4.0#static-private-methods-9446-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-9446)), they've just implemented static private getters and setters.

> **NOTE** (remove before publishing) Frontend Masters has made a one-time donation of 2k in August, and a few days after they donated other 5k

Another big shout out goes to [**Frontend Masters**](https://frontendmasters.com/), which during the last month has been the sponsor who donated more, and to all [our other sponsors](https://opencollective.com/babel#contributors), which allow the Babel team spending more time on the project!

If you or your company want to:trollface: support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/babel) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to both fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users and taking ownership of the code. Reach out to Henry at [henry@babeljs.io](mailto:henry@babeljs.io) if you'd like to talk more!

## Highlights

### Private static accessors (getters and setters) ([#10217](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10217))

```javascript=
class Resource {
  static #loaderInstance = null;

  static get #loader() {
    if (!this.#loaderInstance) this.#loaderInstance = new Loader();
    return this.#loaderInstance;
  }

  status = null;
  
  constructor(url) {
    this.status = Resource.#loader.load(url);
  }
}
```

Thanks to [Tim](https://github.com/tim-mc) (Bloomberg) for implementing this proposal!

You can test this new feature by adding `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods` to your config, if you haven't already added it, or by enabling the `stage-3` preset in the online [repl](https://babeljs.io/repl/build/master#?presets=stage-3).

Class private features support is finally complete 😄🎉

### V8 intrinsic runtime functions parsing ([#10148](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10148))

> :warning: This is a non-standard extension to the language, which can only be used in V8 when enabled using the `--allow-natives-syntax` compiler flag.

V8, the JavaScript engine used by Node.js and Chromium-based browsers, exposes different native functions internally used when executing your code. They can be useful, for example, to understand how much your code is optimized (or deoptimized), to inspect some JS values or to call some routines used in the ECMAScript specification.

These native functions have a different syntax than normal functions: their name always start with `%`. Also, they can only be directly called and never used as normal values (you can't, for example, assign them to another variable).

```javascript=
function fn() { /* ... */ }

const status = %GetOptimizationStatus(fn);

if (status === 2) {
  console.log("The function is not optimized!");
}
```

You can find the whole list of existing native V8 functions in [V8's source code](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/runtime/runtime.h).

You can enable this syntax in `@babel/parser` by using the `v8intrinsic` plugin:

```javascript=
const { parse } = require("@babel/parser");

parse(code, {
  plugins: ["v8intrinsic"]
})
```
