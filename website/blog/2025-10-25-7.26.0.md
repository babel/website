Babel 7.26.0 was just released!

It enables by default support of two ECMAScript proposals that become standard in the last TC39 meeting, [import attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with) and [inline regular expression modifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Modifier), as well as parsing of [Flow enums](https://flow.org/en/docs/enums/).

Babel now also allows plugins to provide asynchronous `pre`/`post` hooks, and has an [experimental mode](TODO: Link) to preserve tokens' positions when generating the transformed output.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.26.0).

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://github.com/babel/babel?sponsor=1) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### Inline RegExp modifiers ([#16692](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16692))

[Inline regular expression modifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Modifier) allow enabling or disabling the `i`/`m`/`s` flags for just part of a regular expression. For example, `/hello (?i:world)/` matches any string that contains `"hello "` as-is, followed by `"world"` with any casing: `hello world` and `hello WoRlD` match, while `Hello world` does not.

The proposal reached Stage 4 in the October 2024 TC39 meeting, and will be included in the next version of the JavaScript standard. `@babel/preset-env` will now automatically transpile this feaatures based on your [compilation targets](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets), and you can safely remove `@babel/plugin-proposal-regexp-modifiers` from your config.

If for any reason you still need to explicitly list the plugin, it has now been renamed to `@babel/plugin-transform-regexp-modifiers` as the proposal became a standard langauge feature.

### Import attributes ([#16579](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16579))

The [import attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with) proposal also reached Stage 4 in the October 2024 TC39 meeting. It supports providing some parameters to the underlying platform indicating how to load modules:

```javascript
import "./my-module" with { some_param: "hello" };
```

Currently, the only widely supported attribute is `type`, which can be used to import JSON or (on the web) CSS modules:
```javascript
import data from "./data" with { type: "json" };
```

Babel will now parse import attributes by default, so you can safely remove `@babel/plugin-syntax-import-attributes` and `@babel/plugin-syntax-import-assertions` from your configuration.

:::warning
The old syntax, using `assert` instead of `with`, has been removed from the proposal. By default Babel will **not** parse it.
:::

Since it become a standard JavaScript feature, `@babel/plugin-proposal-json-modules` has now been renamed to [`@babel/plugin-transform-json-modules`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-transform-json-modules). Note that this plugin is not included in `@babel/preset-env`, as you'll only want to use it if you are not using a bundler or if your bundler does not support importing JSON modules.

### Rewriting `.ts` extensions in dynamic `import()` ([#16794](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16794))

Babel has supported rewriting `.ts` extensions to `.js` in import declarations since last year, using the [`rewriteImportExtensions`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-typescript#rewriteimportextensions) option of `@babel/preset-typescript`:

```ts
// Input
import { hello } from "./dep.ts";
let myVar: number = hello();

// Output
import { hello } from "./dep.js";
let myVar = hello();
```

We are happy to see that TypeScript [is introducing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-7-beta/#path-rewriting-for-relative-paths) a similar option. However, there is a difference: Babel only used to transform paths in _static_ import declarations (since they are the only ones that can always be statically analysed), while TypeScript will also support rewriting it in _dynamic_ import expressions.

Babel 7.26 aligns to TypeScript's future behavior, by also rewriting extensions in dynamic `import()`:

```ts
// Input
await import("./dep.ts");
await import(url);

// Output
await import("./dep.js");
await import(url.replace(/\.ts$/, ".js")); // simplified
```
