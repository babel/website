I'll be writing up the 7.0 post (our current progress) soon so look out for that! We want to do whatever we can to make it easy for both end-users and plugin/tool authors to upgrade seamlessly: whether it be a beta period for the release, a [7.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/1146), codemods if necessary, a bot to automatically upgrade your OSS project from 6 to 7, or any other suggestions you can give us!

Since not everyone realises, I wanted to re-iterate again that our [team](https://github.com/babel/babel#team) is still a small group of volunteers. There's no company sponsor or even anyone working on it full time.

We'd love for you to contribute (especially not code!), so please reach out to us! More designers, technical writers/editors, and teachers for our website would be amazing.

And in other news, Babel has been accepted as a [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/177-babel) project as well as waiting to hear back as a mentor organization for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!

## 🚀 New Feature

### [#5236](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5236) `transform-es2015-block-scoping`: Add option `throwIfClosureRequired` to throw on slow code. ([@spicyj](https://github.com/spicyj))

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-block-scoping", {
      "throwIfClosureRequired": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

In cases such as the following, it is impossible to rewrite let/const without adding an additional function and closure while transforming:

```js title="JavaScript"
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
```

In extremely performance-sensitive code, this can be undesirable. If `"throwIfClosureRequired": true` is set, Babel throws when transforming these patterns instead of automatically adding an additional function.

### [#4812](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/4812) `transform-react-constant-elements`: Support pure expressions ([@STRML](https://github.com/STRML))

Adds a `path.isPure()` check to the plugin.

> The expression will remain in the hoisted code, even though it could be statically evaluated. UglifyJS/Babili will take care of that in many cases.

In

```js title="JavaScript"
const OFFSET = 3;

var Foo = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <div tabIndex={OFFSET + 1} />
    );
  }
});
```

Out

```js title="JavaScript"
const OFFSET = 3;

var _ref = <div tabIndex={OFFSET + 1} />;

var Foo = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return _ref;
  }
});
```

> Deopt

As noted in [facebook/react#3226](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3226), it's not safe to reuse elements with mutable props.

```js title="JavaScript"
<div style={
  { width: 100 }
} />
```

### [#5288](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5288) `babel-preset-flow`: Add new preset ([@thejameskyle](https://github.com/thejameskyle))

`babel-preset-flow` just includes `transform-flow-strip-types`.

Before (still valid)

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "plugins": ["transform-flow-strip-types"]
}
```

After

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "presets": ["flow"]
}
```

> FYI: the React preset still includes the flow plugin by default (we might change it when TS support is added)

Thanks to [@simnalamburt](https://github.com/simnalamburt) for giving us the package name!

### [#5230](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5230) `babel-traverse`: Add extra sibling methods ([@chitchu](https://github.com/chitchu))

For plugin authors: there's already a `path.getSibling(number)`, so we're adding a few helper methods.

```js title="JavaScript"
path.getPrevSibling(); // path.getSibling(path.parentPath.key - 1)
path.getNextSibling(); // path.getSibling(path.parentPath.key + 1)
path.getAllPrevSiblings(); // returns Array<NodePath> of previous siblings
path.getAllNextSiblings();// returns Array<NodePath> of next siblings
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

> Because almost every bug fix can be an opportunity to learn more about JavaScript and how the tool that you use works, I would check out some of the PRs!

### [#5298](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5298) Fix loose `transform-es2015-for-of` with label. ([@jridgewell](https://github.com/jridgewell))

```js title="JavaScript"
b: for (let c of d()) { // previously, the label was completely dropped
  for (let e of f()) {
    continue b;
  }
}
```

### [#5153](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5153) `transform-react-constant-elements`: Hoisting fixes ([@STRML](https://github.com/STRML))

> Better hoisting inside variable declarations

Input

```js title="JavaScript"
function render() {
  const bar = "bar", renderFoo = () => <foo bar={bar} baz={baz} />, baz = "baz";

  return renderFoo();
}
```

Output

```js title="JavaScript"
function render() {
  const bar = "bar",
        renderFoo = () => _ref2,
        baz = "baz",
        _ref2 = <foo bar={bar} baz={baz} />;

  return renderFoo();
}
```

> Hoisting with Higher Order Components

Input

```js title="JavaScript"
const HOC = component => component;

const Parent = () => (
  <div className="parent">
    <Child/>
  </div>
);

export default Parent;

let Child = () => (
  <div className="child">
    ChildTextContent
  </div>
);
Child = HOC(Child);
```

Output

```js title="JavaScript"
const HOC = component => component;

const Parent = () => _ref;

export default Parent;

var _ref2 = <div className="child">
    ChildTextContent
  </div>;

let Child = () => _ref2;
Child = HOC(Child);

var _ref = <div className="parent">
    <Child />
  </div>;
```

### [#5143](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5143) `transform-react-constant-elements`: Fix `PathHoister` hoisting JSX member expressions on `this` ([@STRML](https://github.com/STRML))

`<this.component />` was previously hoisted outside its own function (doesn't make sense because otherwise `this` would be `undefined`)

```js title="JavaScript"
function render() {
  this.component = "div";
  return () => <this.component />;
}
```


```js title="JavaScript"
function render() {
  this.component = "div";

  var _ref = <this.component />;

  return () => _ref;
}
```

### [#5030](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5030) `transform-do-expressions`: Prevent multiple return statements in a loop when replacing expressions. ([@existentialism](https://github.com/existentialism))

```js title="JavaScript"
let p
let a = do {
  while (p = p.parentPath) {
    if (a) {
      'a'
    } else {
      'b'
    }
  }
};
```

```js title="JavaScript"
let p;
let a = function () {
  var _ret;

  while (p = p.parentPath) {
    if (a) {
      _ret = 'a';
    } else {
      _ret = 'b';
    }
  }
  return _ret; // previously had an extra return
}();
```

### [#5260](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5260) `babel-register`: Fix a TypeError with the cache. ([@xtuc](https://github.com/xtuc))

### [#5206](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5206) `babel-traverse`: Deopt evaluation of undefined with a local binding ([@boopathi](https://github.com/boopathi))

If `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity` are redefined, deopt.

### [#5195](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5195) `babel-plugin-transform-runtime`: Don't compile certain symbol properties. ([@taion](https://github.com/taion))

Don't pull in the individual `Symbol.asyncIterator`/`Symbol.observable` polyfills and pull in the full `Symbol` polyfill instead.

### [#5258](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5258) `babel`: Check if it is installed globally and displays correct cli message. ([@xtina-starr](https://github.com/xtina-starr))

Now if you install `babel` the error message will display either `-g` or not.

### [#5270](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5270) `babel-generator`: Emit parens for await of ternary expressions. ([@erikdesjardins](https://github.com/erikdesjardins))

```js title="JavaScript"
async function asdf() {
  await (1 ? 2 : 3);
}
```

### [#5193](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5193) `babel-generator`: Fix missing parens when `FunctionExpression` is a tag in a template string. ([@existentialism](https://github.com/existentialism))

```js title="JavaScript"
(() => {})``;
(function(){}``);
```

### [#5235](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5235) `transform-es2015-modules-commonjs`: Limit export node default assignment stack size #4323. ([@mattste](https://github.com/mattste))

An interesting issue when importing/exporting a lot!

```js title="JavaScript"
import { foo, foo1, foo2 ... } from "foo"; // assume ... is 100 imports/exports
export { foo, foo1, foo2 ... }
```

Part of the generated code looks like:

```js title="JavaScript"
exports.Foo6 = exports.Foo5 = ...
```

Thus with a file that [exports a lot of modules](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/c9af9606bcea6551ceaadc2f6430d629eb679e84/src/svg-icons/index.js) it creates so many nested assignment nodes in the AST the code generator errors with `Maximum call stack size exceeded`.

The solution is to break up the expression into sets of 100.

Output

```js title="JavaScript"
exports.foo100 = undefined; // split by 100
exports.foo99 = exports.foo98 = ... exports.foo1 = exports.foo = undefined
```

### [#5255](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5255) `babel-generator`: Use `trim` instead of `lodash/trimEnd` for codegen performance ([@jwbay](https://github.com/jwbay))

> `lodash/trimEnd` executes a regex against potentially massive strings which can freeze node. (106ms vs. 5ms)

### [#5050](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5050) `babel-traverse`: Rewrite `Hub` as an interface ([@yongxu](https://github.com/yongxu))

> This was reverted due to an incompatible change to babel-core

There are a few cases where `babel-traverse` can't be used standalone so this removes some code that tied `babel-traverse` to `babel-core`'s implementation.
