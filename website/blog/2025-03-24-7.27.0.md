Babel 7.27.0 is out!

This release doesn't include any significant new feature, but it better aligns Babel's behavior with standard JavaScript and other tools.

The code printer will now also print the correct [import attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with) syntax by default, rather than expecting its users to explicitly enable an option for it.

We also tweaked the behavior of `@babel/preset-typescript`'s `rewriteImportExtensions` option, to fix some differences when compared to TypeScript's `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.

Lastly, we updated our `estree` compatibility plugin in `@babel/parser` to generate `AccessorProperty` nodes for `accessor foo = "val"` class properties, introduced by the [decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) stage 3 proposal. Note that, for legacy compatibility reasons, `@babel/parser` only generates an ESTree-compatible AST for class features when the `classFeatures` option of the `estree` plugin is enabled.

There are multiple changes that may benefit plugin authors: you can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.26.0).

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://github.com/babel/babel?sponsor=1) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users.

## Highlights

### `rewriteImportExtensions` tweaks ([#17118](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17118))

Babel 7.26.0 [added support for dynamic `import()`](https://babeljs.io/blog/2024/10/25/7.26.0) when using the [`rewriteImportExtensions`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-typescript#rewriteimportextensions) option of `@babel/preset-typescript`, to align with TypeScript's new [`rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-7/#path-rewriting-for-relative-paths).

However, we then found a difference when it comes to handling non-relative paths: Babel would rewrite `import("/foo/bar/baz.ts")` to `import("/foo/bar/baz.js")`, while TypeScript would leave it as-is. As Babel's goal is to mirror TypeScript's option when possible, we consider this difference to be a bug and we are fixing it in Babel 7.27.0.

### Print import attributes by default ([#16977](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16977))

Babel first implemented import attributes years ago, when the proposal was still called "module attributes" and had a different syntax:
```javascript
import data from "./data.json" with type: "json";
```

When we shipped standards-compliant import attributes, we kept the existing generator behavior. This means that when printing the following AST:
```js
ImportDeclaration {
  specifiers: [],
  source: StringLiteral("./data.json"),
  attributes: [
    ImportAttribute { key: Identifier("type"), value: StringLiteral("json") }
  ]
}
```
we would generate `import "./data.json" with type: "json"` instead of `import "./data.json" with { type: "json" }`.

`@babel/generator` will not generate `import "./data.json" with { type: "json" }`, to match standard JavaScript syntax. It will keep generating the old syntax when either:
- The [`importAttributesKeyword`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-generator#options) option is set to `"with-legacy"`
- The AST has been generated by _parsing_ the old syntax, which will define a `.extra.deprecatedWithLegacySyntax: true` property on the `ImportDeclaration` node.
