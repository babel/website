We just published Babel 7.17.0!

After years of [iterations](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/09/17/decorators), rewrites and adjustments it looks like the [decorators proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) has finally stabilized again on a new design! This release includes both parse and transform support for the new proposal.

We also implemented the [RegExp `v` flag proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-set-notation) and added parsing support for [destructuring private fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-destructuring-private), both currently Stage 2. Lastly, a new experimental implementation of `@babel/register`.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.17.0).

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel#category-CONTRIBUTE) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/babel/babel?sponsor=1) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### Decorators ([#14004](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14004), [#13681](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/13681))

After receiving feedback from JavaScript developers, engine developers and language experts, [the decorators proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/) was rewritten to take into account multiple constraints and desires. We collaborated with the current proposal author, [@pzuraq](https://www.pzuraq.com/) to implement the new Stage 2 proposal in Babel.

The new implementation also supports decorating private class elements, as well as the new "class auto accessors" syntax:

```javascript
@defineElement("button")
class Button {
  @reactive accessor enabled = true; // class auto accessors

  @event("onClick") #handleClick() { // decorator on a private method
    console.log("clicked!");
  }
}
```

You can enable the new proposal by passing the `"version": "2021-12"` option to [`@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators):

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators", {
        "version": "2021-12"
    }]
  ]
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While the new decorators syntax is compatible with the previous proposal, the semantics are different: decorators already written for Babel _"legacy"_, Babel _older-but-not-legacy_, or TypeScript will not work with the new proposal.

If you want to help move the proposal forward, you can try using it and leave feedback in [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/issues).

### RegExp set notation and properties of strings ([#14125](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14125))

Babel now supports the [RegExp set notation and properties of strings](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-set-notation/) proposal, which introduces three new regular expression features behind a new `v` flag:
- Extended set notation, which allows computing difference, intersection and union of characters or strings sets
  ```javascript
  /[\p{Decimal_Number}--[0-9]]/v; // Non-ASCII decimal digits
  /[\p{ASCII}&&\p{Letter}]/v; // ASCII letters
  /[[\p{ASCII}&&\p{Letter}]\p{Number}]/v; // ASCII letters, or any digit
  ```
- Properties of strings, which allow using `\p` escapes with multi-codepoint properties
  ```javascript
  "Did you see the üë©üèø‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üèæ emoji?".match(/\p{RGI_Emoji}/v). // ["üë©üèø‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üèæ"]
  ```
- Multi-codepoint strings in sets, using a new `\q` escape
  ```javascript
  /[\r\n\q{\r\n|NEWLINE}]/v; // Matches \r, \n, \r\n or NEWLINE
  ```

You can enable this proposal using the [`@babel/plugin-proposal-unicode-sets-regex`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-unicode-sets-regex) plugin:
```json
{
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-unicode-sets-regex"]
}
```

Babel relies on different third-party packages to transform regular expressions: we are grateful to the maintainers of [regjsparser](https://github.com/jviereck/regjsparser/), [regjsgen](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/regjsgen) and [regexpu-core](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regexpu-core/) who took time to review our pull requests!

### `@@` and `^^` topic tokens for Hack-style pipes ([#13973](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/13973))

We are continuing to help the proposal authors evaluate different tokens for the [pipeline operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) proposal: one of the champions, [J. S. Choi](https://jschoi.org/), added support for two new tokens that you can try with the `topicToken` option:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator", {
      "proposal": "hack",
      "topicToken": "^^" // or "@@"
    }]
  ]
}
```

You can read more about the supported variations in the [`@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator) docs.

### Experimental `@babel/register` rewrite ([#13782](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/13782))

We plan to release Babel 8 as an ESM package. However, this poses a big problem: how to load and run it synchronously in CommonJS packages?

Usually most Babel consumers can run Babel asynchronously, or at least _load_ it asynchronously. This isn't true for [`@babel/eslint-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) (which integrates Babel's parser with ESLint) and [`@babel/register`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register) (which can be used to transpile Node.js files on-the-fly), where we need to move parsing and transforming to a separate worker.

Babel 7.16.0 exposes the new experimental `@babel/register` implementation at `@babel/register/experimental-worker`: it internally runs Babel asynchronously, so it's compatible with [`.mjs` configuration files](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files#configuration-file-types) and with `.mjs` Babel plugins. It will be enabled by default in Babel 8, and you can already use it as a replacement for `@babel/register` with a few caveats:
- If you programmatically specify `@babel/register` options (using `require("@babel/register")({ /* ... options */ })`), you must make sure that they are serializable. This means that you cannot pass plugin functions defined inline, but you must move them to a separate `./my-plugin.js` file or to a `babel.config.js` file.
- The new implementation is still experimental: it _should_ have the same features as the existing one, but there are a few [improvements](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14025#issuecomment-1003547657) that we are exploring.

We already released the new experimental `@babel/eslint-parser` implementation in [Babel 7.15.0](https://babeljs.io/blog/2021/07/26/7.15.0#preparing-babeleslint-parser-for-babel-8-13398httpsgithubcombabelbabelpull13398), exposed at `@babel/eslint-parser/experimental-worker`.
