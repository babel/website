Babel 7.25.0 is out!

`@babel/preset-env` now supports the [duplicated named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups) proposal for Regular Expressions by default, as well as a bugfix for class fields when targeting Safari. This version also improves support for compiling [JSON module imports](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-json-modules) to CommonJS, and adds support for config files to `@babel/node`'s `--eval` mode.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.25.0).

> If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://github.com/babel/babel?sponsor=1) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### Duplicated named capturing groups ([#16445](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16445))

The [duplicated named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups) proposal allows re-using the same name for groups in alternative branches within a regular expression. For example, a RegExp that matches dates either in the `dd/mm/yyyy` or `yyyy-mm-dd` format could be written as

```javascript
let re =
  /(?<day>\d\d)\/(?<month>\d\d)\/(?<year>\d\d\d\d)|(?<year>\d\d\d\d)-(?<month>\d\d)-(?<day>\d\d)/;

"21/12/2023".match(re).groups.day; // 21
"2023-12-21".match(re).groups.day; // 21
```

The proposal reached Stage 4 in the April 2024 TC39 meeting, and will be included in the next version of the JavaScript standard. It is thus now enabled by default in `@babel/preset-env` (when needed based on your [targets](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets)), and you can safely remove `@babel/plugin-proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups-regex` from your configuration.

If for any reason you still need to explicitly list the plugin, it has now been renamed to `@babel/plugin-transform-duplicate-named-capturing-groups-regex` as the proposal became a standard language feature.

### Simplify JSON modules imports in CommonJS ([#16579](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16579))

After introducing support for transforming [JSON modules](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules) imports in Babel 7.24.0, we realized that the generated output was not friendly to CommonJS bundlers.

Given this code:

```javascript
import myConfig from "./config.json" with { type: "json" };
```

[`@babel/plugin-proposal-json-modules`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-json-modules) would compile it to the following, when targeting CommonJS on Node.js:

```javascript
const myConfig = JSON.parse(
  require("fs").readFileSync(require.resolve("./config.json"))
);
```

The `JSON.parse` + `readFileSync` combination is necessary to ensure that `config.json` is indeed a JSON file, and not a `config.json.js` file trying to sneakily execute some code while being loaded.

`@babel/plugin-proposal-json-modules` has now an `uncheckedRequire` option to simplify the output, at the cost of less validation. You can enable it in your configuration:

```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-json-modules", { "uncheckedRequire": true }]
  ]
}
```

and Babel will generate the following code:

```javascript
const myConfig = require("./config.json");
```

### `@babel/plugin-bugfix-safari-class-field-initializer-scope` ([#16569](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16569))

Safari versions up to 16 (included) have [a bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236843) when using parentheses around expressions in class fields. For example, the following code would throw an error:

```javascript
{
  let a = [3];
  new (class {
    c = a[0];
  })();
}
```

This is especially problematic when using Webpack or when compiling to CommonJS, as they add parentheses when transforming imports. For example, this input code:

```javascript
import { hello } from "./dep";

class A {
  prop = hello();
}
```

would become

```javascript
var _dep = /* ... */;

class A {
  prop = (0, _dep.hello)();
}
```

[David Taylor](https://github.com/davidtaylorhq) implemented a fix (thanks!) in the new `@babel/plugin-bugfix-safari-class-field-initializer-scope` package, which is enabled by default in `@babel/preset-env` when your targets include Safari versions up to 16.
