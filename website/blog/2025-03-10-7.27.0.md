Babel 7.27.0 is out!

Babel now supports parsing and transforming the Stage 2 [discard binding proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-discard-binding), for cases were you are forced to define an unused variable. Babel's code printer will now also print the correct [import attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with) syntax by default, rather than expecting its users to explicitly enable an option for it.

We also tweaked the behavior of `@babel/preset-typescript`'s `rewriteImportExtensions` option, to fix some differences when compared to TypeScript's `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.

There are multiple changes that may benefit plugin authors: you can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.26.0).

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://github.com/babel/babel?sponsor=1) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### Discard Bindings ([#17163](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17163))

The Stage 2 [discard binding](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-discard-binding) proposal allows using `void` as a variable name when the syntax construct you are using requires defining a variable, but you are not actually using that variable anywhere. It is especially useful together with the [explicit resource management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) proposal, since resources can only be registered for disposal by assigning them to a variable.

For example:
```javascript
function increase() {
  // Here we would normally have to do "using lock = ...",
  // but we are not using the lock variable anywhere
  using void = connection.acquireLock();

  connection.set(connection.get() + 1);

  // the lock is automatically released here
}
```
Which can be tested with the following Babel plugins:
```json title="babel.config.json"
{
  "plugins": [
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-explicit-resource-management",
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-discard-binding", { "syntax": "void" }]
  ]
}
```

It can also be useful to make elision in array destructuring more visible, or when you need to have unused function parameters before ones that you actually use:
```javascript
const [void, void, optionValue] = process.argv;

function doSomething(x, void, y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

### `rewriteImportExtensions` tweaks ([#17118](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17118))

Babel 7.26.0 [added support for dynamic `import()`](https://babeljs.io/blog/2024/10/25/7.26.0) when using the [`rewriteImportExtensions`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-typescript#rewriteimportextensions) option of `@babel/preset-typescript`, to align with TypeScript's new [`rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-7/#path-rewriting-for-relative-paths).

However, we then found a difference when it comes to handling non-relative paths: Babel would rewrite `import("/foo/bar/baz.ts")` to `import("/foo/bar/baz.js")`, while TypeScript would leave it as-is. As Babel's goal is to mirror TypeScript's option when possible, we consider this difference to be a bug and we are fixing it in Babel 7.27.0.
