`@babel/preset-env` is a smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environment(s). This both makes your life easier and JavaScript bundles smaller!

## Install

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
```

Or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn add @babel/preset-env --dev
```

## How Does it Work?

`@babel/preset-env` would not be possible if not for a number of awesome open-source projects, like [`browserslist`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist), [`compat-table`](https://github.com/kangax/compat-table), and [`electron-to-chromium`](https://github.com/Kilian/electron-to-chromium).

We leverage these data sources to maintain mappings of which version of our supported target environments gained support of a JavaScript syntax or browser feature, as well as a mapping of those syntaxes and features to Babel transform plugins and core-js polyfills.

> It is important to note that `@babel/preset-env` does _not_ support `stage-x` plugins.

`@babel/preset-env` takes any [target environments you've specified](#targets) and checks them against its mappings to compile a list of plugins and passes it to Babel.

## Browserslist Integration

For browser- or Electron-based projects, we recommend using a [`.browserslistrc`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) file to specify targets. You may already have this configuration file as it is used by many tools in the ecosystem, like [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), [eslint-plugin-compat](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat) and many others.

By default `@babel/preset-env` will use [browserslist config sources](https://github.com/ai/browserslist#queries) _unless_ either the [targets](#targets) or [ignoreBrowserslistConfig](#ignorebrowserslistconfig) options are set.

For example, to only include polyfills and code transforms needed for users whose browsers have >0.25% market share (ignoring browsers without security updates like IE 10 and BlackBerry):

[Options](options.md#presets)

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "useBuiltIns": "entry"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**browserslist**

```
> 0.25%
not dead
```

or

**package.json**

```
"browserslist": "> 0.25%, not dead"
```

## Options

For more information on setting options for a preset, refer to the [preset options](presets.md#preset-options) documentation.

### `targets`

`string | Array<string> | { [string]: string }`, defaults to `{}`.

Describes the environments you support/target for your project.

This can either be a [browserslist-compatible](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) query (with [caveats](#ineffective-browserslist-queries)):

```json
{
  "targets": "> 0.25%, not dead"
}
```

Or an object of minimum environment versions to support:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "chrome": "58",
    "ie": "11"
  }
}
```

Example environments: `chrome`, `opera`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`, `ie`, `ios`, `android`, `node`, `electron`.

Sidenote, if no targets are specified, `@babel/preset-env` will transform all ECMAScript 2015+ code by default.

> We don't recommend using `preset-env` this way because it doesn't take advantage of its ability to target specific browsers.

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

#### `targets.esmodules`

`boolean`.

You may also target browsers supporting ES Modules (https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-modules). When specifying this option, the browsers field will be ignored. You can use this approach in combination with `<script type="module"></script>` to conditionally serve smaller scripts to users (https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/#nomodule-for-backwards-compatibility).

> _Please note_: when specifying the esmodules target, browsers targets will be ignored.

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "esmodules": true
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

#### `targets.node`

`string | "current" | true`.

If you want to compile against the current node version, you can specify `"node": true` or `"node": "current"`, which would be the same as `"node": process.versions.node`.

#### `targets.safari`

`string | "tp"`.

If you want to compile against the [technology preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) version of Safari, you can specify `"safari": "tp"`.

#### `targets.browsers`

`string | Array<string>`.

A query to select browsers (ex: last 2 versions, > 5%, safari tp) using [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist).

Note, browsers' results are overridden by explicit items from `targets`.

> Note: this will be removed in later version in favor of just setting "targets" to a query directly.

### `spec`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Enable more spec compliant, but potentially slower, transformations for any plugins in this preset that support them.

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Enable ["loose" transformations](http://2ality.com/2015/12/babel6-loose-mode.html) for any plugins in this preset that allow them.

### `modules`

`"amd" | "umd" | "systemjs" | "commonjs" | "cjs" | "auto" | false`, defaults to `"auto"`.

Enable transformation of ES module syntax to another module type. Note that `cjs` is just an alias for `commonjs`.

Setting this to `false` will preserve ES modules. Use this only if you intend to ship native ES Modules to browsers. If you are using a bundler with Babel, the default `modules: "auto"` is always preferred.

#### `modules: "auto"`
By default `@babel/preset-env` uses [`caller`](options.md#caller) data to determine whether ES modules and module features (e.g. `import()`) should be transformed. Generally `caller` data will be specified in the bundler plugins (e.g. `babel-loader`, `@rollup/plugin-babel`) and thus it is not recommended to pass `caller` data yourself -- The passed `caller` may overwrite the one from bundler plugins and in the future you may get suboptimal results if bundlers supports new module features.

### `debug`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Outputs the targets/plugins used and the version specified in [plugin data version](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-env/data/plugins.json) to `console.log`.

### `include`

`Array<string|RegExp>`, defaults to `[]`.

An array of plugins to always include.

Valid options include any:

- [Babel plugins](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-compat-data/scripts/data/plugin-features.js) - both with (`@babel/plugin-transform-spread`) and without prefix (`plugin-transform-spread`) are supported.

- [Built-ins](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-env/data/built-in-features.js), such as `es6.map`, `es6.set`, or `es6.object.assign`.

Plugin names can be fully or partially specified (or using `RegExp`).

Acceptable inputs:

- Full name (`string`): `"es6.math.sign"`
- Partial name (`string`): `"es6.math.*"` (resolves to all plugins with `es6.math` prefix)
- `RegExp` Object: `/^transform-.*$/` or `new RegExp("^transform-modules-.*")`

Note that the above `.` is the `RegExp` equivalent to match any character, and not the actual `'.'` character. Also note that to match any character `.*` is used in `RegExp` as opposed to `*` in `glob` format.

This option is useful if there is a bug in a native implementation, or a combination of a non-supported feature + a supported one doesn't work.

For example, Node 4 supports native classes but not spread. If `super` is used with a spread argument, then the `@babel/plugin-transform-classes` transform needs to be `include`d, as it is not possible to transpile a spread with `super` otherwise.

> NOTE: The `include` and `exclude` options _only_ work with the [plugins included with this preset](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-compat-data/scripts/data/plugin-features.js); so, for example, including `@babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions` or excluding `@babel/plugin-proposal-function-bind` will throw errors. To use a plugin _not_ included with this preset, add them to your ["plugins"](options.md#plugins) directly.

### `exclude`

`Array<string|RegExp>`, defaults to `[]`.

An array of plugins to always exclude/remove.

The possible options are the same as the `include` option.

This option is useful for "blacklisting" a transform like `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator` if you don't use generators and don't want to include `regeneratorRuntime` (when using `useBuiltIns`) or for using another plugin like [fast-async](https://github.com/MatAtBread/fast-async) instead of [Babel's async-to-gen](plugin-proposal-async-generator-functions.md).

### `useBuiltIns`

`"usage"` | `"entry"` | `false`, defaults to `false`.

> This option adds direct references to the `core-js` module as bare imports. Thus `core-js` will be resolved relative to the file itself and needs to be accessible. You may need to specify `core-js@2` as a top level dependency in your application if there isn't a `core-js` dependency or there are multiple versions.

This option configures how `@babel/preset-env` handles polyfills.

#### `useBuiltIns: 'entry'`

> NOTE: Only use `require("@babel/polyfill");` once in your whole app.
> Multiple imports or requires of `@babel/polyfill` will throw an error since it can cause global collisions and other issues that are hard to trace.
> We recommend creating a single entry file that only contains the `require` statement.

This option enables a new plugin that replaces the statement `import "@babel/polyfill"` or `require("@babel/polyfill")` with individual requires for `@babel/polyfill` based on environment.

```sh
npm install @babel/polyfill --save
```

**In**

```js
import "@babel/polyfill";
```

**Out (different based on environment)**

```js
import "core-js/modules/es7.string.pad-start";
import "core-js/modules/es7.string.pad-end";
```

This will also work for `core-js` directly (`import "core-js";` or `require('core-js');`)

#### `useBuiltIns: 'usage'` (experimental)

Adds specific imports for polyfills when they are used in each file. We take advantage of the fact that a bundler will load the same polyfill only once.

**In**

a.js

```js
var a = new Promise();
```

b.js

```js
var b = new Map();
```

**Out (if environment doesn't support it)**

```js
import "core-js/modules/es6.promise";
var a = new Promise();
```

```js
import "core-js/modules/es6.map";
var b = new Map();
```

**Out (if environment supports it)**

```js
var a = new Promise();
```

```js
var b = new Map();
```

#### `useBuiltIns: false`

Don't add polyfills automatically per file, or transform `import "@babel/polyfill"` to individual polyfills.

### `forceAllTransforms`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

<p><details>
  <summary><b>Example</b></summary>

With Babel 7's [JavaScript config file](config-files#javascript) support, you can force all transforms to be run if env is set to `production`.

```js
module.exports = function(api) {
  return {
    presets: [
      [
        "@babel/preset-env",
        {
          targets: {
            chrome: 59,
            edge: 13,
            firefox: 50,
          },
          // for uglifyjs...
          forceAllTransforms: api.env("production"),
        },
      ],
    ],
  };
};
```

</details></p>

> NOTE: `targets.uglify` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major in
> favor of this.

By default, this preset will run all the transforms needed for the targeted
environment(s). Enable this option if you want to force running _all_
transforms, which is useful if the output will be run through UglifyJS or an
environment that only supports ES5.

> NOTE: Uglify has a work-in-progress "Harmony" branch to address the lack of
> ES6 support, but it is not yet stable. You can follow its progress in
> [UglifyJS2 issue #448](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/448). If you
> require an alternative minifier which _does_ support ES6 syntax, we recommend
> using [babel-minify](preset-minify.md).

### `configPath`

`string`, defaults to `process.cwd()`

The starting point where the config search for browserslist will start, and ascend to the system root until found.

### `ignoreBrowserslistConfig`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

Toggles whether or not [browserslist config sources](https://github.com/ai/browserslist#queries) are used, which includes searching for any browserslist files or referencing the browserslist key inside package.json. This is useful for projects that use a browserslist config for files that won't be compiled with Babel.

### `shippedProposals`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

Toggles enabling support for builtin/feature proposals that have shipped in browsers. If your target environments have native support for a feature proposal, its matching parser syntax plugin is enabled instead of performing any transform. Note that this _does not_ enable the same transformations as [`@babel/preset-stage-3`](preset-stage-3.md), since proposals can continue to change before landing in browsers.

The following are currently supported:

**Builtins**

- [es7.array.flat-map](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-flatMap)

**Features**

- None

## Caveats

### Ineffective browserslist queries
While `op_mini all` is a valid browserslist query, preset-env currently ignores it due to [lack of support data](https://github.com/kangax/compat-table/issues/1057) for Opera Mini.
