    Compiling in the browser has a fairly limited use case, so if you are
    working on a production site you should be precompiling your scripts
    server-side. See <a href="/docs/setup/#build-systems">setup build systems</a>
    for more information.

You can use `@babel/standalone` as a precompiled version of Babel or run a bundler on Babel yourself. Check the usage section below for how to use it as a script.

You can also use the many online tools to prototype a script:

- [Babel's own REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/babel-repl-custom-plugin-7s08o?file=/src/index.js)

Online Editors that run Babel for you:

- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/fh5whLfd/)
- [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/rokimopuse/edit?html,js,console,output)
- [Codepen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dOGgeO)
